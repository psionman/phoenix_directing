## Scoring

Ensure that you have the latest version of the *phoenix_bbonames.txt* file on your computer (see [The *phoenix_bbonames.txt* file](bbo_names)).

The procedures must be carried out in the order in which they appear below. Any stage can be repeated if, for example, some names are missing from the *phoenix_bbonames.txt* file.

**NB** If for any reason you do not intend to send a player's results to the EBU, then temporarily change their EBU number in the *phoenix_bbonames.txt* file to **888888**.

If you need to **adjust scores** this can be done during the scoring process before the *BBO to XML converter* (see BBO_XML_ below).

###### Create the files for uploading

Launch the Chrome browser and open the urls shown at [Multiple URL Opener addon](chrome) in different tabs.

1. Navigate to the club's BBO Tournament list at:

    [http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/tarchive.php?m=h&h=vEBU211328&d=vEBU211328](http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/tarchive.php?m=h&h=vEBU211328&d=vEBU211328)

    You might have to login using the director's login (vEBU211328) and password.

    This will list the club's tournaments (they stay here for one week only).

    ![Find tournament](/images/scoring_01.png)

1. Click on *boards* against the tournament you want (check the date).

    It might indicate that the scores are not ready. We have no control over when BBO make the files available, but it should be within a few hours.

    When the results are available you will see a screen similar to:

    ![List travellers](/images/scoring_02a.png)

1. Check later boards to make sure there are no averages. Adjust if necessary.

1. Take the 15 character code in the heading of the board list after *Tourney*

    (e.g. *9779-1591639307*).  Concatenate it with the URL:

    [http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/tview.php?t=](http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/tview.php?t=)

    to give a link similar to:

    ```text
    http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/tview.php?t=9779-1591639307
    ```

    Use this created URL to navigate to a screen similar to:

    ![Pairs scores](/images/scoring_03.png)

    Click on the *BBX* icon in the browser (top right).

    The *BBO Running* alert will appear:

    ![BBO Running](/images/scoring_10.png)

    This process generates a scorecard every few seconds and the screen will flash alarmingly for some seconds.

    When it's finished you will see a dialog box:

    ![BBO Extractor](/images/bbo_extractor.png)

    Click on *OK* and you will see the final dialog:

    ![PBN File Extractor](/images/scoring_07.png)

1. The following two files should now be in your *Downloads* directory:

    * \<tournament name and date>.csv
    * \<tournament name and date>.pbn

    Check that they are there. If not, re-run the conversion.

1. Open the BBO to XML converter [https://dds.bridgewebs.com/bbotoxml/bbotoxml.htm?p=1](https://dds.bridgewebs.com/bbotoxml/bbotoxml.htm?p=1).

    If any scores need adjustment, **do it now**!

    a. Click on *Review/Edit CSV* in the top left of the form. You will be asked to select a file, and it should be the *\<tournament name and date>.csv* file created in stage 7 above.

    ![Select file for editing](/images/scoring_08.png)

    b. Click on *Edit Scores*.

    ![Edit a score](/images/scoring_09.png)

    c. Make the changes you need to, and click on *Save CSV*. You may the proceed as below.

1. Complete the fields as shown (except *Master Points*). Note that the *Club ID number* is the 6 character EBU number, and the *UMS Charge Rate* should be 10. Enter your name as the Contact.

    Click on the *Load Names* button and open the *phoenix_bbonames.txt* file when requested. When done it will show
    a message: *xx names loaded* where *xx* is the number of names in *phoenix_bbonames.txt*.

    ![XML Converter](/images/scoring_04.png)

    (The order of the fields on this page might vary - check)

1. Click on *Create XML file* and select the relevant **csv** file from the downloads folder.

    This will create an *XML* file named *\<tournament name and date>_UMS.xml* (this will be used in *Sending P2P to EBU* below).

    Check that the file is in your *Downloads* directory, if not, re-run.

1. Click on *Create XML for Bridgewebs* and again select the csv file.

    This will create a second *XML* file in downloads named *\<tournament name and date>.xml* (this will be used in *Sending to Bridgewebs* below).

    Check that the file is in your *Downloads* directory, if not, re-run.

    Note, there are two *xml* files with similar names: one with *UMS* and one without.

###### Sending to Bridgewebs

1. Navigate to the Phoenix Bridgewebs site at [https://www.bridgewebs.com/phoenix](https://www.bridgewebs.com/phoenix/)
and click on *Administration* in the left-hand menu. Enter the BridgeWebs password.

    ![Results to Bridgewebs](/images/scoring_05.png)

    Here, you will be selecting files from from your *Downloads* directory.

1.    Against *Select the Results file*, select *\<tournament name and date>.xml*.

1.    Against *Select the Deal File*, select *\<tournament name and date>.pbn*.

You can navigate around the scores and boards to satisfy yourself that the upload has worked correctly

###### Sending P2P to EBU

1. On the EBU website at [https://www.ebu.co.uk/members/v2/](https://www.ebu.co.uk/members/v2/), click on *My EBU*;

1. Enter the club EBU number and password;

1. Click on the *submit* tab on the top-right. Use *Browse* to select the file:

    *\<tournament name and date>_UMS.xml*

    from your *Downloads* directory;

1. Click on *Upload*.

1. You might get a request to resolve unknown players (for example if you have used substitutes) - they are guests

###### Cleaning up redundant files

When you are satisfied that the results have all been uploaded, it might be as well to remove the work files from your *Downloads* directory. This is to avoid any confusion in future weeks because the file names will look similar. The files to remove are:

1. *\<tournament name and date>.pbn*

1. *\<tournament name and date>.xml*

1. *\<tournament name and date>_UMS.xml*

1. *\<tournament name and date>.csv*

And that is it for that tournament!
