## Opening the session

Opening the session allows player to sit at the tables. This can be done at any time, although the earlier you start the longer people have to move around and chat before the game.

## Starting the session

Immediately before the start of the session it might be necessary to adjust the movement and the number of boards per round

| Tables | Boards / Round |Rounds | Boards Played |Movement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 6 | 3 | 18 |Howell |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 20 | Howell |
| 4 | 3 | 7 | 21 | Howell |
| 5-8 | 2 | 9 | 18 | Howell |
| 9+ | 2 | 9 | 18 | Mitchell |

(for half tables go to the point one above  - e.g. for 4.5 tables, use 5)

Use the *Tables -* button to get rid of empty tables.

Click on the *Start round 1* button.

## During the session

You can see the progress of each table trick by trick in the table number icon in the table list

The *E* indicates that the table has completed the board but is not ready to move on. If you think this is stuck you should visit the table and, if necessary force the board to finish.

When more than half the tables have completed the round, the Move button is displayed and enabled for the Director. The name of the button shows which round it relates to.

If some tables have not finished the round, their opponents in the following round will have to wait - just like live bridge.

If a table seems to be struck, you can visit at director and if they have finished the round you can click on the *End Round* button to move them on.

If a table is very slow you can visit the table and if you decide it is appropriate, you can skip a hand - they will receive an average score.

It is nice to make an announcement prior to moving, allowing people to finish their conversations. 

You can visit any table at any time and not just when you are called.

You can kick a player from a table to the lobby.  Click on *Advanced* (in top bar), then under *Remove Player* select the player you want to eject and click on *Kick player to lobby*.

## Scoring

Log in as director and click on the *USBIO* button at the top right. A new panel will appear

With the mouse right-click on the *USEBIO file* and select *Save link as ...*

This should save a file with a name similar to *210325121204PhoenixBridgeClub.xml* (Look for the *xml* extension - in Windows you might have to [turn on extensions](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1784.windows-how-to-view-file-name-extensions.aspx#:~:text=Windows:%20How%20to%20View%20File%20Name%20Extensions%20,check%20box,%20and%20then%20click%20OK.%20See%20More)). In your *Downloads* directory. Check the date and time to make sure it is the file that you want.

Similarly, right-click on *PBN file and save the file with a name similar to *210325121204PhoenixBridgeClub.pbn*.

## Destroying the session

*Real Bridge* ask us to destroy sessions as soon as reasonable after it has finished. DO NOT destroy the session until the scores have been extracted.

Log in as director and click on the *Advanced* button at the top right. A new panel will appear
