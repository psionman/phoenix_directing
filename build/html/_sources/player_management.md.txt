# Managing players

Only members or players who are registered with the club can sign up for an event. Non-members are allowed up to 4 sessions with the club before they must join. This is managed on BBO by using the *Entries* tab in the *Edit Tournament* function:

Members will be on the *custom list* and non-members given access to the tournament will be in *Include players followed by the host*.

## Members

Normally members will be added to, or deleted from, the BBO *custom list*, directly, but should that list become corrupted or there are doubts about its validity, then a new list can be uploaded.

### Add or remove a username

1. click on the *Director* tab
1. click on *Include/Exclude Lists* (at the bottom). You will see a box similar to

1. to add a username, click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and click on the tick sign in the edit field to confirm
1. to delete a username click on the dustbin symbol next to the username (the username is deleted immediately)
1. open for edit all pending tournaments and click on *Modify tournament* to pick up the changes

### Create and upload a custom list

1. create a text file of members' BBO usernames
1. login to BBO using the club's username and password
1. click on the *Director* tab

1. in *Source file* select the text file of member's usernames

## Non-members

Any non-members who wish to play have to register and need to be added as a friend of the director. As people may sign-up up to two hours before the tournament starts, this should be done before 5pm. To check for new registrations see [Managing players](player_management). After their four attendances, they will either become members and must be added to the member's list, or removed from the Director's friends (to do this right click on the user name in the friends list and click on *Unfollow*. When you refresh the usernames it will have been removed.)

It is the responsibility of the person adding the player to the list to police the number of visits. (This need not be rigorously enforced in extenuating circumstances)

## When players register

The club has a policy of only allowing *registered* players to play in tournaments (unless substitutes are invited by the director).

Members (and/or friends) can register to play with Phoenix by completing the on-line form at this URL: [https://forms.gle/L12pMv4KjxFkx2DdA](https://forms.gle/L12pMv4KjxFkx2DdA)

This page takes you through the steps that you need to make sure that a player is registered to play. In particular we must add new players to the BBO site so that they can play in our tournaments. You should go through the following process before every tournament.

### Add players to the club's BBO "*friends*"

This should be done before the start of the tournament as players may wish to play straightaway (see the note below).

When a player registers their details will appear in this on-line workbook [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLdT67k0hdONGrm2uKFwJbjO8RcYBOj5Rj3SXpfior0/edit#gid=617644318](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLdT67k0hdONGrm2uKFwJbjO8RcYBOj5Rj3SXpfior0/edit#gid=617644318)

![Player Workbook](/images/players_01.png)

The player's BBO login name appears in column 3.

1. Login to BBO with the club director's login name. Go to the *People* panel;
1. Enter the player's name in the *Friend* field and press \<RTN>;
1. You can check that the player has been added by scrolling the list (they might be off-line) and looking at their profile.

    Note that if the player is added after a tournament has been created and they wish to play in it, you  must modify the tournament (e.g. add a full stop or space to the tournament name) and re-save.

1. Adjust the *last player* cell on the worksheet so that we record when players have been processed.
