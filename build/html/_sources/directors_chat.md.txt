# Director's chat

This document contains some suggestions for chat to be used during tournaments. Use them at your pleasure. Just copy and paste into the chat line on BBO.

## Before tournament starts
Hi. Welcome to Phoenix Bridge Club. I'm xxx and I'm directing this evening. The tournament will start in about 5 minutes

Please greet your opponents with a short summary of the system you will be using (including discards) and please remember to self alert all non-natural bids.

I have delayed the start for a few minutes to allow a member to login


## After tournament starts

We have xx tables - one pair of robots

We have xx tables - and happily, no robots

Less than 2 minutes to go on this round. Please claim if you can!

Please do not alert through chat, and please take care not to say anything that might constitute unauthorised information.

## General
Please do not use chat to request or provide information on bidding.

If you want to know the meaning of a bid, please click on the bid in question and the bidder should respond.

If you are asked to explain a bid, please do so in terms that someone not familiar with your system will understand: e.g. "12-14" not "weak" , or "support for major" not "Jacoby".
