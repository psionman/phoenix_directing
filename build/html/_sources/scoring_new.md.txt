### Create tournament

This document is based on the EBU document [Virtual Club Manager](https://blog.bridgebase.com/2020/04/02/the-virtual-club-manager-manual/). This has screen shots, but does not necessarily cover Phoenix's policies.

1. Log into BBO using the club's on-line director's login name and password.

1. Click on the *Director* tab.

1. Click on the *Create Tournament* button.

    In the *Create Tournament* panel there are four tabs:

    1. the *Tournament* tab:

        1. Give the Tournament a title (this is seen by members searching for the tournament when they wish to register), e.g.
            ```text
            Phoenix Bridge Club 8 June 2020
            ```

        1. Create a Welcome Message (This is seen by members when they sign up for the tournament.)

        1. In the *Description* field enter:
            ```text
            +availall+
            ```
            This is case sensitive and must be entered exactly as shown! This means that the tournament will not start until all members registered for the tournament are logged in.

            This generates a Mitchell movement. Other movements might be more appropriate if there are fewer than nine tables ([see table at the end of this section](#howell)).

        1. Enter the hours, days and minutes until the tournament will start.

            The actual start time will be generated and shown for you to check. (The tournament remains hidden in the BBO events screen until two hours before the start time.)

        1. Enter the BBO username of any other director associated with the event (if any). Please ensure that the *Club's* director (vebu211328) is at the top of the list as all director's calls go to the director at the top.

        1. The format should say *pairs*

    1. the *Format* tab:

        1. Enter the number of hands to be played (18 or 24 for example)

        1. The minutes to be allowed per board (6, 7 or 8 for example). If a table has not completed a board they will be moved on at the expiry of the time at the table and BBO will attempt to allocate a score. If all of the tables have finished early, they will be moved on.

        1. The number of boards per round (2 or 3 for example)

        1. Scoring should be *Matchpoints*

        1. Barometer checked to allow players to see their scores during the game.

        1. Movement should be *clocked*

        1. Deal Source: *Use random deals*

    1. the *Options* tab:

        1. Kibitzers: *Do not allow*

        1. Allow chat to tournament: uncheck both *players* and *kibitzers*

        1. Table options: uncheck *undos*

    1. the *Entries* tab:

        1. Set the *Maximum entries*. This is the maximum number of *pairs* that will be allowed to register. (Generally we have no limit. The default is 40 which should be adequate.)

        1. Uncheck *Allow robots*. This means that players will not be able to elect to play with a robot as a partner.

        1. In *Type* enter *BBUL*

        1. Set the *Entry fee* to 300 (Note this is in cents not dollars)

        1. Uncheck *Stars plays free*

        1. In *Restrictions* check:

            1. Include players followed by host

            1. Include custom list.

1. Finally, click on *Create Tournament*.

| Tables | Description | Boards | Boards/round | Works for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3-4 | +availall+ +howell+ +hm18+ | 18 | 3 | 3-6 tables |
| 5-8 | +availall+ +howell+ +rounds9+ | 18 | 2 | 5-15 tables |
| 9+ | +availall+ | 18 | 2 | 9+ tables |

For more details see [Howell Movements](../Howell.pdf)

**NB** Most things can be modified up to the point that the tournament starts, except *Allow robots* in the *Entries* section.

###### Copying a tournaments

As we are holding weekly tournaments, and the general format will not change, it makes sense to use the *Copy Tournament* function to create next week's tournament. A good time to do this, might be when the director has logged on before the start of a tournament.

To create next week's tournament, click on the *Directors* tab, select *Pending Tournaments*, and click on week's tournament. Choose *Edit Tournament* from the menu, and when the *Create Tournament* box appears, click on *Copy Tournament*. It then only remains to change the *Title* and add 7 days to the *Time until start*. Then click on *Modify Tournament* to save.
