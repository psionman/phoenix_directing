# Introduction


This document describes the actions required by a director to initiate, run and score a duplicate event on BBO.

## Resources

Before you start you will need:

1. the club's BBO director's login (*vEBU211328*) and the related password;

1. the club's BridgeWebs password;

1. your personal EBU number and password.

(The latter two are needed for scoring only.)

## Documentation

This document is divided into sections that describe (in detail) the functions involved in running a BBO tournament:

1. [Manage the club's on-line players](player_management);

1. [create a tournament](create_tournament);

1. [run the tournament](directing_a_tournament);

1. [keeping the bbo names file up to date](bbo_names);

1. [scoring](scoring).

These functions are quite independent and do not need to be undertaken by the same person.

The [Browser](browser) section describes setting up your browser for scoring and need only be undertaken once.
