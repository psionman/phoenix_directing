# Replaying hands

It is possible to replay hands after the end of the tournament. This might be useful if, for example, there should be a query on the scoring. This can be done through the [BBO website](#replaying-hands-on-bbo), or, if the scores have been uploaded to BridgeWebs, on the [Phoenix website](#replaying-hands-on-phoenix-web-site).
